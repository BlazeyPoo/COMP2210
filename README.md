COMP2210 with Dr. Dean Hendrix

This GitHub is for my personal use as a way to document my projects and access them from anywhere.
Using this GitHub to plagiarize my projects or to submit them as your own is not only a poor life decision, but also goes against Auburn's Academic Honesty Code and can get you in a lot of trouble.
